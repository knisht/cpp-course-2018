## 1. Long number arithmetics in nasm(Windows x32 implementation)
  Addition, subraction and multiplication of <512-bit numbers, input and and output use WinAPI.
  
## 2-3. Long number arithmetics in C++ using copy-on-write and small-object optimizations
  Almost all common operations that are use integral types. Pretty well optimized :)
  
## 4. Huffman compressor
  Library with huffman algorithm and command-line tool for file encoding/compressing.
  
  Interface: `pack <filename.ext>`, `unpack <filename.ext>`
