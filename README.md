## 1. Long number arithmetics in nasm(Windows x32 implementation)
  Addition, subraction and multiplication of <512-bit numbers, input and and output use WinAPI.
  
## 2-3. Long number arithmetics in C++ using copy-on-write and small-object optimizations
  Almost all common operations that are use integral types. Pretty well optimized :)
